### Sea ice observational data tools

- Repo I made for downlaoding, reading and plotting the [NSIDC Sea Ice Index](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index)

- To download the data, run the script by doing:
```
./downloader.sh
```
- Create and activate the conda environment by running:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate seaiceobs
```
